 🏆 IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:

1. Tauri Desktop App Setup 🔥
   - Currently missing src-tauri folder - need to initialize Tauri
   - Native file system access instead of web APIs
   - Desktop app packaging and distribution
2. Real ML Backend Pipeline 🔥
   - Currently using mock/localStorage - need actual Python ML training
   - Connect FastAPI server to real scikit-learn/pandas processing
   - Persistent model storage (pickle files, not localStorage)
3. Data Preprocessing Pipeline 🔥
   - Missing feature engineering, encoding, scaling
   - Handle missing values, outliers, data types
   - Data validation and cleaning workflows

  🎯 HIGH PRIORITY:

4. Model Versioning & Management
   - Model registry with version tracking
   - Model comparison and rollback capabilities
   - Metadata storage (training date, performance, config)
5. Enhanced Model Performance Monitoring
   - Cross-validation metrics beyond accuracy
   - Feature importance visualization
   - Model interpretation (SHAP, LIME)

  📊 MEDIUM PRIORITY:

6. Advanced EDA Features
   - Interactive plotting (plotly integration)
   - Automated feature selection recommendations
   - Statistical tests and correlation analysis
7. Export & Deployment
   - ONNX model export for production
   - REST API generation for trained models
   - Docker containerization

  🎨 NICE TO HAVE:

8. UI/UX Improvements
   - Dark mode toggle
   - Drag-and-drop file interface
   - Progress indicators for long operations

  Which would you like to tackle first? I recommend starting with Tauri setup since it's foundational for the desktop app experience.
